I am a data scientist, open source contributor, and instructor. I am passionate about building tools for data scientists and training future data scientists. I am also a graduate student at Georgia Tech where I am researching EdTech and student retention.

I do the vast majority of my open source work on GitHub, and I do my best to keep my [profile](https://github.com/MasonGallo) up to date. You can see the courses I've taught as well as my upcoming courses at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/mason-gallo/5839)
